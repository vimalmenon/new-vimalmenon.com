		`
			My name is <span class="highlight"> Vimal Menon</span>. I am a self-taught developer and have learned it all from YouTube.  I never had any formal education in computer science and, I was still able to make a carrier in software development. I have experience working in both frontend and backend technology and I have worked with leading international banks and other sectors.
		`,
		`
			So if you guys want to make a carrier in software development without any degree. I will show you guys everything you need to know to get into this industry.  I am going to start from very basic like how I started and will show you a path to take to get a job as a software engineer.
